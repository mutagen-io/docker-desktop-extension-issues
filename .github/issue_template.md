If you have a question about the Mutagen Docker Desktop extension, or a feature
request, please use the Mutagen Community Slack Workspace to discuss:

https://mutagen.io/slack


For security issues, or even those that you merely suspect might be
security-related, please see the documentation for reporting security issues:

https://github.com/mutagen-io/mutagen/blob/master/SECURITY.md


Issue templates aren't one-size-fits-all, so please feel free to summarize your
issue in whatever format you feel is most appropriate, but please include
relevant information such as:

- The version of the extension that you're using
- The version of Docker Desktop that you're using
- The platform(s) that you're using (e.g. operating system/version/architecture)
- Reproduction steps (and ideally a test case to reproduce the issue)

The more information you provide, the easier it will be to diagnose the problem.


Thanks for taking the time to submit a report!
